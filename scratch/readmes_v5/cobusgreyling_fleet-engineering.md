> **You don’t have an agent problem. You have a population problem. Get a Fleet Ready score.**

**Fleet engineering is replacing ad-hoc populations of agents with an accountable organization. You design the registry, identity, permissions, inbox, audit trail, and sovereign control that let many loops run safely across a team.**

```bash
npx @cobusgreyling/fleet-init .
npx @cobusgreyling/fleet-audit . --suggest
# Optional: attach a loop layer
npx @cobusgreyling/fleet-init . --with-loop daily-triage
```

A fleet is not "many agents." A fleet is a **governed population** where every action answers one sentence:

> *Which agent did it, with what authority, against what task, evidenced by what?*

## Start here (pick your pain)

| Symptom | Start with |
|---------|------------|
| "We have agents everywhere" | [Team Agent Registry](patterns/team-agent-registry.md) |
| Agents act without oversight | [Shared Inbox HITL](patterns/shared-inbox-hitl.md) |
| Token bill surprise | [Fleet Budget Guard](patterns/fleet-budget-guard.md) |
| "Who did this?" in an incident | [Cross-Agent Audit](patterns/cross-agent-audit.md) |
| Already have loops | [Fleet + Loop starter](starters/fleet-plus-loop/) |

Unsure? Use the [Pattern Picker](docs/pattern-picker.md).

## The Stack

| Layer | Unit of design | Question |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| [Context Engineering](https://cobusgreyling.medium.com/context-engineering-a34fd80ccc26) | One inference | What does the model see? |
| [Harness Engineering](https://cobusgreyling.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-ai-harness-engineering) | One agent run | How does a single run execute safely? |
| [Loop Engineering](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/loop-engineering) | One autonomous system | What keeps prompting and verifying over time? |
| **Fleet Engineering** | Many agents + loops | How do populations coordinate and govern at scale? |

## Getting Started (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Scaffold fleet + optional loop layer
npx @cobusgreyling/fleet-init ~/my-fleet --pattern team-agent-registry --with-loop daily-triage

# 2. Audit readiness (schema + shadow-agent checks)
npx @cobusgreyling/fleet-audit ~/my-fleet --suggest

# 3. Roll up caps and attribute spend
npx @cobusgreyling/fleet-budget ~/my-fleet
npx @cobusgreyling/fleet-cost ~/my-fleet

# 4. Start F1: registry + permissions only — no unattended L2+ loops
```

**GitHub template:** enable "Template repository" in repo settings, then [Use minimal-fleet template](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/fleet-engineering/generate).

From a clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cobusgreyling/fleet-engineering.git
cd fleet-engineering && npm install && npm test
node tools/fleet-init/cli.js /tmp/fleet-demo --pattern team-agent-registry
```

Phased rollout: **F0 ad-hoc → F1 catalog + inbox → F2 shared agents + budgets → F3 enterprise governance**

## The Seven Fleet Primitives

| Primitive | Job in the Fleet |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Registry** | What agents exist, who owns them, version, lifecycle |
| **Identity & credentials** | Claw (service) vs assistant (act-as-user) |
| **Permissions & sharing** | clone / run / edit; workspace vs individual |
| **Inbox / escalation** | Fleet-wide HITL; approve/reject across agents |
| **Observability & audit** | Traces, decision evidence, cross-agent search |
| **Economics** | Budgets, quotas, cost attribution per agent/team |
| **Sovereign control** | Kill switch, rollback, autonomy tiers |
